# 21-DAY INTENSIVE ML LEARNING ROADMAP

## Overview
This roadmap provides a structured, fast-paced learning journey through machine learning fundamentals and applications using the Model-View-Analysis (M-V-A) framework. Each day combines theory with hands-on practice to ensure rapid skill acquisition.

## How to Use This Roadmap
1. **Daily Kick-off (15 min)**: Review the day's topic and set specific goals
2. **Learning Blocks**: Complete 3 Ã— 45-minute focused coding sessions
3. **End-of-day M-V-A Ritual (10 min)**:
   - **Model**: Document what you built
   - **View**: Save visualizations and results
   - **Analysis**: Write a brief critique and plan improvements
4. **Push your work**: Commit your progress and update your learning diary

## DAY 0: Setup (1-2 hours)
- [X] Install Python 3.11, VS Code/Jupyter, create GitHub account
- [X] Create repository "ml-learn"
- [x] Set up virtual environment and install requirements
- [X] Create learning-diary-day0.md for daily reflections


## Resources
- **Datasets**: Scikit-learn built-ins, Kaggle, UCI ML Repository
- **Documentation**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **Books**: Python Data Science Handbook, Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
- **Courses**: Fast.ai, Kaggle Learn, Coursera ML specializations
