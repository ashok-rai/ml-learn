> An interactive, fast-paced, and impact-focused machine learning curriculum designed for rapid skill acquisition using the Model-View-Analysis (M-V-A) framework.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a structured 21-day learning path for mastering machine learning fundamentals and practical applications. The curriculum follows the Model-View-Analysis pattern:

- **Model**: Build something concrete each day
- **View**: Visualize and present your results
- **Analysis**: Critically evaluate and iterate

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this 21-day sprint, you will:

1. Master Python fundamentals for data science and ML
2. Understand and implement key ML algorithms
3. Build a portfolio of mini-projects
4. Develop intuition for model selection and evaluation
5. Create deployable ML applications
6. Establish daily learning habits using the M-V-A framework

## 🗓️ Roadmap Structure

### 📚 Foundations Week (Days 1-7)
Focus on Python, math fundamentals, and basic ML concepts.

### 🧠 Modeling Week (Days 8-14)
Explore various ML algorithms and techniques.

### 🚀 Deep Learning & Deploy Week (Days 15-21)
Dive into neural networks and model deployment.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Git/GitHub account
- VS Code or Jupyter Notebook
- Enthusiasm for daily practice!

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/21-Day-ML-Sprint.git
   cd 21-Day-ML-Sprint
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv ml-env
   source ml-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ml-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create your learning diary**
   ```bash
   touch learning-diary.md
   ```

## 📝 Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Kick-off (15 min)**
   - Review the day's topic
   - Set specific learning objectives
   - Prepare your environment

2. **Learning Blocks**
   - Complete 3 × 45-minute focused coding sessions
   - Take short breaks between sessions

3. **End-of-day M-V-A Ritual (10 min)**
   - **Model**: Document what you built
   - **View**: Save visualizations and results
   - **Analysis**: Write a brief critique and plan improvements

4. **Push your work**
   - Commit and push your daily progress
   - Update your learning diary

## 📊 Detailed Daily Schedule

### Foundations Week (Days 1-7)

#### Day 1: Python Core Blitz
- **Model**: Implement 5 core Python functions
- **View**: Use doctests and simple prints
- **Analysis**: Measure runtime performance

#### Day 2: NumPy & Pandas Crash
- **Model**: Array operations and DataFrame manipulations
- **View**: Data visualization with Seaborn
- **Analysis**: Missing data strategy

*[... continues with all 21 days as in the roadmap ...]*

## 🔄 The M-V-A Learning Framework

The Model-View-Analysis framework is designed to ensure you:

1. **Build something concrete** (Model) every day
2. **Visualize your results** (View) to develop intuition
3. **Critically evaluate** (Analysis) to improve continuously

This cycle reinforces learning through immediate feedback and iteration.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Track your progress by:

1. Checking off completed days in this README
2. Maintaining your learning diary with daily entries
3. Committing code and visualizations to your repository
