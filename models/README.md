# Models Directory

This directory contains machine learning models and related code developed during the 21-day ML learning journey.

## Structure

- `sample_model.py`: Example implementation of a simple linear regression model
- `saved_models/`: Directory for storing trained model files (to be created)

## Sample Model

The `sample_model.py` file provides a template for implementing models from scratch. It includes:

- A `SimpleLinearRegression` class with:
  - Gradient descent training algorithm
  - Prediction functionality
  - Model evaluation metrics
  - Model saving and loading utilities

## Best Practices for Model Development

1. **Modular Design**: Separate model architecture from training and evaluation
2. **Documentation**: Include docstrings explaining parameters and functionality
3. **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds for consistent results
4. **Validation**: Implement cross-validation to assess model performance
5. **Serialization**: Save trained models for later use
6. **Version Control**: Track model changes and performance

## Model Persistence

Models can be saved and loaded using the following pattern:

```python
# Save a model
model.save('models/saved_models/my_model.pkl')

# Load a model
loaded_model = SimpleLinearRegression.load('models/saved_models/my_model.pkl')
```

## Model-View-Analysis Framework

When developing models as part of the M-V-A framework:

1. **Model**: Implement the core algorithm and training procedure
2. **View**: Visualize model performance and predictions
3. **Analysis**: Evaluate strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements

Document these three aspects in your learning diary for each model developed.
