# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for each day of the 21-day ML learning journey.

## Notebook Structure

Each notebook follows a consistent structure aligned with the Model-View-Analysis framework:

1. **Introduction**
   - Learning goals for the day
   - Key concepts to be covered
   - Required libraries and imports

2. **Model Component**
   - Implementation of algorithms/models
   - Code for data processing and transformation
   - Core functionality for the day's topic

3. **View Component**
   - Visualizations of results
   - Data exploration plots
   - Model performance metrics

4. **Analysis Component**
   - Critical evaluation of results
   - Comparison of approaches
   - Insights and limitations
   - Ideas for improvement

## Naming Convention

Notebooks are named according to the following pattern:
- `day01_python_core.ipynb`
- `day02_numpy_pandas.ipynb`
- etc.

## Best Practices

1. **Run All Cells**: Before committing, run all cells to ensure reproducibility
2. **Clear Outputs**: Consider clearing outputs before committing (reduces file size)
3. **Markdown Documentation**: Use markdown cells to explain your thought process
4. **Code Comments**: Add inline comments for complex operations
5. **Modular Code**: Break down complex tasks into functions
6. **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling in your code
7. **Version Control**: Track notebook changes with git

## Getting Started

To begin working with a notebook:

1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source ml-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ml-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the notebook for the current day and start coding!
