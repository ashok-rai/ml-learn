## PREPARATION TIPS
1. **Block calendar time**: Add these sessions to your calendar with reminders
2. **Minimize distractions**: Turn off notifications during learning blocks
3. **Prepare workspace**: Have notebook, water, and resources ready before each session
4. **Set daily alarms**: 15 minutes before each session to mentally prepare
5. **Share schedule**: Let family/roommates know your focused learning times

## CONTINGENCY PLAN
- If you miss a day: Dedicate 1 hour the next day to catch up, focusing on key concepts
- If you fall behind: Use weekend buffer time to catch up (add 2 hours on Saturday)
- If a concept is challenging: Allocate 30 extra minutes from evening leisure time

## POST-JOURNEY PLAN
- Day 22-23: Buffer days for any incomplete topics
- Day 24-25: Review and consolidate learning
- Day 26-30: Begin planning next learning phase
