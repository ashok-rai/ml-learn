# Visualizations Directory

This directory contains visualizations generated during the 21-day ML learning journey.

## Structure

- `.png` files: Static visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- `plotly/` directory: Interactive HTML visualizations created with Plotly
- `visualization_examples.py`: Python script with example visualization code

## Usage

The `visualization_examples.py` script provides templates for:
- Basic Matplotlib plots (line, scatter, subplots)
- Seaborn statistical visualizations (distributions, regression, heatmaps)
- Interactive Plotly charts (requires plotly package)

Run the script to generate example visualizations:

```bash
python visualizations/visualization_examples.py
```

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with date stamps
2. **Documentation**: Include a brief description of what each visualization shows
3. **Reproducibility**: Save the code that generated each visualization
4. **Organization**: Group related visualizations in subdirectories by project/day

## Model-View-Analysis Framework

When creating visualizations as part of the M-V-A framework:

1. **Model**: What data/model is being visualized?
2. **View**: What visualization technique best shows the patterns?
3. **Analysis**: What insights can be drawn from the visualization?

Document these three aspects in your learning diary for each visualization.
